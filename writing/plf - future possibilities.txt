add sub-entities as default for entity class

change add_entity to entity-side function, add_block *only*, on quad side - avoids potential problems with inherited entities

Sprite-batching, if it becomes available through SDL at some stage:
// Things to do to enable texture batching:
// 1. Include pointer to texture manager in each texture
// 2. At draw, texture checks whether 'batch_enabled' is true in parent
// 3. If true, texture calls 'add_to_batch' in parent with atlas texture, and coordinates/angle/rotation point/flips/etc
// 4. Parent adds these to sub-vector of structs with draw coordinates + angle etc, inside map with texture atlas pointer as key.
// 5. On 'draw_batch' command, texture manager processes & draws all textures, one atlas after another
// 6. multitextures are drawn immediately, they cannot be batched - hence very large textures will always be behind other textures. Realistically this makes sense, as textures that large are usually backgrounds.

Add entity-placement constraints to all adding functions in plf_layer
