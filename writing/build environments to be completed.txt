All tools here are free:

1. IDE's:

Main IDE: Codelite.
www.codelite.org
- Adding new compilers is found under settings->build settings->add compiler
- Supports all compilers
- Cross-platform
- Easy to use
- Includes CPPCheck (use it)
- Debugging quite good - conditional breakpoints are invaluable


Secondary IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2013
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx
- Has great code checking facilities (solution->right click->code analysis->enable & enable all warnings - slow, so only need to do this occasionally)
- Can sometimes make debugging easier
- Gives more warnings, generally.
- More robust than 2015 at this stage


2. Compilers you need to be testing with:
- GCC - mingw TDM x64 version. x86 builds enabled by adding '-m32' to both compile and link commands. '-O2;-march=native' for best performance under release code. It's more lenient with a lot of stuff, so I would use this as the default compiler for most compilers. Currently fastest performing in terms of resultant code.
tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download
- Clang - will pick up some errors or warnings GCC won't.
llvm.org/releases/download.html
- MSVC - Generally results in slower code than either of the above but often provides more warnings, and more pedantic warnings. Ignore the 'insecure' function warnings.

3. Libraries needed:
- SDL - the core library
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
- SDL_image - supports all image formats, whereas SDL only supports BMP. Makes some image-related tasks easier.
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
- SDL_mixer - for sound and music. Broken as hell, in terms of design, but robust and works on all platforms, unlike alternatives.
https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

Each is a C library. This means they are not object-oriented, but imperative solutions. You will need the 'development library' downloads for each. 
There are sites on the web for learning the basics of these libraries and how to link to them etc. Probably the best one is lazyfoo's one:

4. Additional tools required:
- Git.


5. Optional tools:
- ConText text editor for windows - freeware notepad replacement with code colouring and much better usage for basic text editing.
